# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete containerization and deployment pipeline for a full-stack application consisting of a React frontend and Node.js backend. The solution will create multi-architecture Docker images using Podman with Node.js 20 as the base image, manage infrastructure with Terraform (using kreuzwerker/docker and AWS providers), push images to Amazon ECR, and deploy them on Amazon ECS Fargate. The frontend will be publicly accessible while the backend will be accessible to the frontend via environment variables and will securely access secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using IAM roles, following AWS security best practices without using hardcoded AWS keys.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to containerize both frontend and backend applications using Podman with multi-architecture support, so that they can be deployed consistently across different environments and architectures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process is triggered THEN the system SHALL create multi-architecture Docker images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) using Podman for both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN creating Docker images THEN the system SHALL use the latest official Node.js 20 image as the base image
3. WHEN creating the frontend Docker image THEN the system SHALL build and serve the React application directly
4. WHEN creating the backend Docker image THEN the system SHALL include all necessary Node.js dependencies and expose the appropriate port
5. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL tag them appropriately for ECR repository naming conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to use Terraform to create ECR repositories and push Docker images, so that infrastructure and image management is automated and version-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use Terraform with kreuzwerker/docker and AWS providers
2. WHEN creating ECR repositories THEN the system SHALL use Terraform to provision separate repositories for frontend and backend
3. WHEN pushing images to ECR THEN the system SHALL authenticate using IAM roles without hardcoded AWS keys
4. WHEN images are pushed THEN the system SHALL use proper tagging strategy including latest and version-specific tags
5. WHEN Terraform is executed THEN the system SHALL place all infrastructure code in the terraform-infra directory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy applications on Amazon ECS Fargate using Terraform, so that they run in a serverless container environment with high availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to ECS THEN the system SHALL use Terraform to create ECS Fargate cluster, task definitions, and services for both frontend and backend
2. WHEN creating task definitions THEN the system SHALL specify appropriate CPU, memory, and port configurations for Fargate
3. WHEN services are created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper health checks and auto-scaling capabilities
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide service endpoints and status information through Terraform outputs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the frontend to be publicly accessible while the backend is accessible to the frontend via environment variables, so that the application follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring networking THEN the system SHALL place frontend in public subnets with internet gateway access
2. WHEN configuring networking THEN the system SHALL place backend in private subnets without direct internet access
3. WHEN setting up load balancing THEN the system SHALL create an Application Load Balancer for public frontend access
4. WHEN configuring service communication THEN the system SHALL provide backend endpoint to frontend through environment variables
5. WHEN setting up security groups THEN the system SHALL restrict backend access to frontend service only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper IAM roles configured for ECS Fargate services to access AWS Secrets Manager, so that applications can securely retrieve secrets at runtime without using hardcoded AWS keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating ECS Fargate services THEN the system SHALL create task execution roles with minimal required permissions for ECR and CloudWatch
2. WHEN backend service needs to access secrets THEN the system SHALL create task roles with Secrets Manager read permissions
3. WHEN configuring IAM THEN the system SHALL follow principle of least privilege
4. WHEN backend accesses secrets THEN the system SHALL use Task Role or Task Execution Role for Secrets Manager authentication
5. WHEN using KMS encryption THEN the system SHALL use the default Secrets Manager KMS key

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to securely read the OpenAI API key from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime, so that sensitive credentials are not hardcoded in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend service starts THEN the system SHALL retrieve the OpenAI API key from AWS Secrets Manager using IAM roles
2. WHEN accessing Secrets Manager THEN the system SHALL use the default Secrets Manager KMS key for encryption
3. WHEN secret retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate logging
4. WHEN secrets are updated THEN the system SHALL be able to retrieve new values without redeployment
5. WHEN configuring secrets access THEN the system SHALL use Task Role permissions for runtime secret retrieval

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build and deployment using Terraform, so that I can deploy changes efficiently with infrastructure as code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL use Terraform to manage the complete infrastructure lifecycle
2. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL use Podman to create multi-architecture images
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL handle the complete pipeline from image build to running ECS Fargate services
4. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN the system SHALL provide outputs for service endpoints and important resource information
5. WHEN infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL support updates and rollbacks through Terraform state management

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want proper VPC and networking configuration managed by Terraform, so that services are secure and can communicate appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use Terraform to create or configure VPC with public and private subnets
2. WHEN configuring subnets THEN the system SHALL ensure high availability across multiple availability zones
3. WHEN setting up routing THEN the system SHALL configure NAT gateway for private subnet internet access
4. WHEN configuring DNS THEN the system SHALL set up service discovery for internal communication
5. WHEN network security is configured THEN the system SHALL implement proper security group rules for each service tier using Terraform
